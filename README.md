# MATLABProjects_HeterodyneReciever
A MATLAB Code that implements an Analog Communications Super Heterodyne Receiver 

## Project Description
This Project uses the power of MATLAB operations and matrices to simulate a close to real Transmitter on a passband bandwidth and recieves on a Heterodyne Reciever. 
The Code first reads the messages(audios) and process them. After that, it multiplies by a cos term to upconvert to a chosen passband. Then, it recieves on an intermediate frequency to avoid the baseband noise. Finally, gets the signal back to baseband and runs the audios to verify success of the operation.
The code also visualizes the process by plotting each step of the process.
